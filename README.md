# QTL-BSA
Bulked Sequence Analysis(BSA) Using QTLv1.0.pl

QTLv1.0.pl, an anlysis pipeline for Bulked Sequence Analysis based on highthroughput whole genome sequencing technology to rapidly locate the quantitative trait loci from two populations, developed in October,2013. If you want to know more about the principle of the method, please refer to the paper: "Takagi Hiroki, Abe Akira, Yoshida Kentaro et,al.QTL-seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations(2013),Plant.J." It contains four step: sequence alignment, sequence realignment, snp calling, and snp dentity graph plotting. 

About installation
If you need to anlysis from the step of the sequence alignment and snp calling, please make sure your linux operating system have installed the following software: bwa,samtools, Coval,R and Perl module(Bio::seq module). Otherwise, make sure you have installed R.
Note: you should modify the path to your software in the QTLv1.0.pl
